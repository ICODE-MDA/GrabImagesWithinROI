Build Instructions. There are two methods for building the code. Once uses CMake, and the other requires the user to setup their own project in Visual Studio.


(1)Manually
- Simply throw all the source code in this directory into a Visual C++ project or IDE/compiler of your choice to compile and run.  Run instructions are included in the ../app directory.

(2)CMAKE
Install CMake Version 2.8.3 or newer.
Edit the file GrabImagesWithinROI\build\build_project.bat to make it agree with your local machine.
Specifically make sure the the following lines are correct.
a)call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
b)set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin;%PATH%
c)set GIWR_INCLUDES=D:\libraries\icode\google-icode-mda\trunk\GrabImagesWithinROI\src
d)cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" -DGIWR_INCLUDES=%GIWR_INCLUDES% ../src/

In (d) if you are using a compiler besides Visual Studio 10, you should change this argument to reflect the generator that you wish to use.

Double click "build_project.bat" and this should create a Visual Studio solution named GrabImagesWithinROI.sln that you can open and use.
